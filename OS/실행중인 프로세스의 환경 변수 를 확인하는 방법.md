How To Check Environment Variables for a Running Process 



**In Linux**

```
strings –a /proc/<pid_of_the_process>/environ
or
ps eww <pid_of_the_process>

ps eww <processid> | tr ' ' '\n' | grep = | sort
```



**In Solaris**

```
pargs -e <pid_of_the_process>
```



**In AIX**

```
strings or ps eww <pid_of_the_process>
```



**In HP-UX**

```
The only way is to attach gdb to the process and examine _environ.

ex)gdb --pid=5579
   GDB) show environment
```



**In Windows**

```
On Windows, you can do this by using a tool such as ProcessExplorer to select a particular process and view the values of the environment variables.

You could also write a small .NET program using:
System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcessById(<pid>).StartInfo.EnvironmentVariables 
```
